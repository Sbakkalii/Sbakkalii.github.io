My Background
------
I received my Ph.D. degree in 2022 in computer science, in the filed of computer vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) from [La Rochelle Universit√©](https://www.univ-larochelle.fr/), La Rochelle, France. My [thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04197696v1/document) was based on the proposal of several Multimodal Document Understanding frameworks Unifying Vision and Language input modalities in a cross-modal learning fashion.  Before, I obtained M.Eng in Information Technology from the [INPT](http://www.inpt.ac.ma/) High School of Engineering in Morocco.


Research Interests

My main research interests include multimodal document analysis, self-supervised vision-language representation learning for document understanding.
